# Programming Paradigms & Exception Handling

## About
This project serves as an introduction to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Exception Handling** in Python. It covers the foundational principles of OOP such as classes, objects, and the core benefits of using OOP to design reusable, modular, and organized code.
Additionally, the project explores how to write more robust programs by handling errors gracefully using Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms. As a bonus, it also introduces the basics of testing, helping you understand how to validate and maintain code reliability as your projects grow.

## Project Objectives:
By the end of this project, I should be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of OOP: classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Discuss the significance of OOP in software development and its advantages over other programming paradigms.
- Define classes and create objects in Python.
- Understand the difference between class attributes, instance methods, and the role of the `self` keyword within classes.
- Differentiate between syntax errors and exceptions in Python.
- Identify common Python exceptions and understand their causes.
- Utilize `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions effectively.
- Raise exceptions using the `raise` keyword and create custom exceptions for specific errors in my code.
- Explain the importance of testing in software development.
- Describe different types of testing, with a focus on unit testing.
- Write basic unit tests using Python's `unittest` module to verify the functionality of your code.
- Structure test cases effectively and understand how test runners work.

This project equips me with the foundational knowledge of OOP and exception handling in Python. These skills are essential for building well-structured, maintainable, and robust Python applications.
