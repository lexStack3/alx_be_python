# Advanced Python Classes and Objects

## About
This project takes deeper dive into the principles and power od **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. Building on foundational OOP knowledge, it introduces and explores advanced concepts such as:
- **Constructors and Destructors** for initializing and cleaning up objects.
- **Magic Methods** to enhance class behavior using Python's special method convention (e.g., `__str__`, `__len__`, `__eq__`)
- **Inheritance** to promote code reuse and model hierarchical relationships between classes.
- **Composition** to build complex objects by combining simplet ones.
- **Polymorphism** to enable objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface.

## Project Objectives:
By the end of this project, I should be able to:
- Describe the functionalities of constructors (`__init__`), destructors (`__del__`), and common magic methods (e.g., `__str__`, `__repr__`) in Python classes.
- Implement inheritance to create new classes that inherit properties and methods from exiting classes.
- Utilize composition as an alternative to inheritance for building complex objects.
- Explain the concepts of single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance in Python.
- Understand the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python and how it affects method calls in inheritance hierarchies.
- Implement polymophism and method overriding to create flexible and reusable code.
- Explain and use Python's duck typing to achieve polymophic behavior.
- Distinguish between class methods and static methods based on their usage and purpose.
- Apply `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` decorators appropriately in your Python classes.

This project will equip me with a comprehensive understanding of advanced OOP concepts in Python, enablying me to design and build robust and maintainable object-oriented applications.
